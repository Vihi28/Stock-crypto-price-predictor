# Stock-crypto-price-predictor
With the growing interest in stock and crypto trading among the people, a huge amount of risk is also associated. This project aims to predict the prices of the stock or crypto on a certain day to help the users make better choices. First, various related models are tested and the model with the highest accuracy is chosen. The models that were tested are: SVM, RNN, LSTM and ARIMA models. Using the chosen model, the price range for various stock items and crypto currencies is predicted. Finally, the model was embedded in the form of a web application that is user-friendly. The users are suggested the prices to invest and withdraw money on and they are also provided a brief analysis on a crypto or stock item. The web application also has a home page and navigation to all the web pages is effectively enabled.
