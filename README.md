The models that were tested are: SVM, RNN, LSTM and ARIMA models. Using the chosen model, the price range for various stock items and crypto currencies can be predicted. Finally, the model was embedded in the form of a user-friendly web application using Flask library. </br> The users are shown the predicted closing price and they are also provided a brief analysis on a crypto or stock item.
