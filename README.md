With the growing interest in stock and crypto trading among the people, a huge amount of risk is also associated. This project aims to predict the prices of the stock or crypto on a certain day to help the users make better choices. </br></br> Various related models were tested and the model with the highest accuracy was chosen. The models that were tested are: SVM, RNN, LSTM and ARIMA models. Using the chosen model, the price range for various stock items and crypto currencies can be predicted. Finally, the model was embedded in the form of a user-friendly web application using Flask library. </br></br> The users are shown the predicted closing price and they are also provided a brief analysis on a crypto or stock item. The web application also has a home page and effectively enabled navigation to all the web pages.
